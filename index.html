                    <h1>Passwords</h1>

                    <p>There are three types of password users in the world; those who remember them, those who don&apos;t, and those who write them down.</p>
                    <p>Those who don&apos;t remember them, but don&apos;t write them down tend to use the same passwords for every site they need to log in to. We are told this is not great for our online security, they break one and they have them all. I&apos;m not sure they&apos;d want to fraudulently purchase goods from the sites I&apos;m signed up to unless they can&apos;t afford to buy their own dog food or they want to know how to make a vegan mousse.</p>
                    <p>If we have different passwords for everything then we are forced to write them down, then you just need to add one burglar and one PC and your online banking and card details are there for them in one neat little package. I&apos;ve tried hiding the book, but couldn&apos;t remember where, let&apos;s face it, it&apos;s always going to be in the vicinity of the home computer or they&apos;d be no point having it.</p>
                    <p>Cellphones and tablets now have this smart technology where you can use fingerprint or eyeball recognition. These do not sit well with me. Firstly, I like to keep my screen clean, and therefore don&apos;t want to add extra smudges every time I need to wake it up from its premature sleep that there seem to be no settings to change. Secondly, I don&apos;t want to be sitting in a bar staring into my cell&apos;s camera, everyone will think I&apos;m taking a close up selfie of my eyeball. Or I&apos;m just a little bit odd.</p>
                    <p>The worst thing about setting passwords is how secretive the companies are about what they&apos;d like from you. You happily enter the password you use for everything, a pop up tells you you need to have at least one upper case letter. Why don&apos;t they list their requirements in advance? It doesn&apos;t stop there, pop-ups all over the place; one special character, 2 numbers, the first number you thought of take away 6, get the idea?</p>
                    <p>So you now have this complicated password you will never remember as it doesn&apos;t include your dog&apos;s name or your child&apos;s date of birth. I&apos;ve been caught out in this way, this is when I will reach for my pen and notepad and write the alien password in the incorrect order using a code I&apos;ve only just made up. When I have then gone to use the password again in three months time I don&apos;t remember the code.</p>
                    <p>At least I know the login details for my online banking are secure, I can&apos;t even get that right most of the time. If I don&apos;t use my fingers to count when selecting any characters over 4 it&apos;s always wrong, I panic if it requests a character over 10. Recently it&apos;s been pretty kind to me, maybe they know. Probably some algorithm that counts how many login errors I&apos;ve made when the questions got too difficult.</p>
                    <p>Passwords, can&apos;t live with them, can&apos;t live without them.</p>
